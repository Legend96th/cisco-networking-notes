  # Metro Ethernet 
  Metropolitan Ethernet
  
  * A MAN technology that uses high-speed Ethernet connection
  * Based on Ethernet
  * Typically uses fiber optics
  * Advantages
    * Easily connects with LANs (since we use Eathernet on MAN and other locations)
    * Less expensive than alternatives (for eg SONET (Synchrounous Optical Network): A fiber optic multiplexing standard that allows multiple channels of communication to share a fiber optic cable)
  * Typical speeds:
    * 10 Gbps
